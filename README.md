ChromaQuant is an open-source toolkit designed to enable users to rapidly and precisely analyze chromatographic data. It offers tools for matching chromatographic signals to each other or to other tabulated data, writing formulas for dynamic Excel reporting, and peforming simple operations on tabulated data to produce properties like molecular weight.<br><br>

The development of ChromaQuant is associated with the <a href="https://www.rorrerlab.com/">Rorrer Lab</a> at the University of Washington Department of Chemical engineering.

<h4>Installation</h4>
Install ChromaQuant in a Python environment by running the following command in the terminal/command prompt while that environment is active:<br><br>
