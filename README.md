<h1>AutoQuant</h1>
A solution for automated gas chromatographic peak assignment and quantification
<h4>Introduction</h4>
This project aims to simplify the workflow for combining gas chromatographic (GC) data collected from multiple sources. More
specifically, it is designed to accommodate the case where GC's with flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors are
used to collect quantitatiive data that must be labelled using data from mass spectroscopic results. This project assumes the
following setup:
<ul>
  <li>A GC equipped with FID/TCD is used to quantify gaseous products from a reaction</li>
  <li>A GC equipped with FID/MS is used to quantify liquid products from a reaction</li>
  <li>A GC equipped with FID/MS is used to label both gas and liquid reaction products</li>
</ul>
This project also assumes that external software can be used to obtain spectra and integration/identification results.
